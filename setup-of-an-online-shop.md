## Course plan

### Prevailing conditions

#### Time planning

The course is planned for a **one week full-time** course with a preceding online phase \(blended mobility\) for students to get to know each other and share business ideas. However, the course can also be used in other course settings, e.g. two lessons weekly etc. If students can access and administrate the shops from home this makes the course concept even more flexible.

#### Technical setup

You will need one setup of the online shop software per group. See the [PrestaClassroom Project](https://github.com/fitforecommerce/presta-classroom.git) for an easy way to set up multiple online shops at once. Here is the requirements for your web server in order to host PrestaShop 1.7.0.3 as stated on the PrestaShop website:

#### Shop Software

There is a wide range of online shop software available \(see the following table\). As in most educational settings money is scarce, the freely available softwares will probably be more interesting. In our project we have decided to use [PrestaShop](https://prestashop.com). Coincidentally two of the project partners LBS Tschuggmall Brixen and Staatliche Berufsschule Bayreuth have come to this decision independently. Both schools have used PrestaShop in projects before and have made good experiences with it. In our opinion the main advantages of PrestaShop are the following:

* PrestaShop comes pre-configured with a fully working setup so there is no additional setup before you can actually see your shop
* students can use the pre-installed data as a starting point for their own shop
* PrestaShop is very motivating for students to be able to see a quick success of their work
* PrestaShop is used in professional enviornments
* PrestaShop is well documented and there are plenty tutorials and other learning materials available
* PrestaShop is freely available
* PrestaShop is open-source software
