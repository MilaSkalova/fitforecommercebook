### Actual Course Plan

1. **Self-Assessment:** Students fill in the self-assessment sheet in order to evaluate their competences and skills \(ideally as an online questionnaire\)
2. **Work Phase:** In a self-organized setting students optimize an existing online shop and create product photography. During the work phase they will have regular meetings with teachers in which they will have to show the progress they made and during which they can also discuss technical, social or organisational issues.
3. **Presentation Phase:** At the end of the work phase the students will have to present the optimizations of their shop and the product photography they created in front of the teachers and other students.
4. **Evaluation Phase:** At the end the outcome of the project will be evaluated. Once again students will have to self-assess their competences. Also teachers will asses the competences of the students. In a short oral feedback both assessments will be compared and discussed. Students can be marked based on the competence sheet.
