## Evaluation of results and conclusion

#### _**General information:**_

At the beginning and at the end of the week the students had to answer a questionnaire with the same questions so that the evaluation of the questionnaire afterwards would show developments and changes in attitudes, knowledges and skills gained by the students during the week.

As the students from Germany and the Czech Republic had to apply for taking part in the project the interpretation of the figures should be seen under the light that motivated students had been chosen for taking part in the project.

Every question had to be answered by choosing “I totally disagree” \(value 1\), “I disagree” \(value 2\), “I agree”\(value 3\), “I totally agree”\(value 4\).

In the following questionnaire you can find the average value of answers at the beginning and at the end of the week:
