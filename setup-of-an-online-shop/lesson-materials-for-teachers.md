Send the following sample emails to the online shops and wait for an appropriate answer:

#### **Asking for quantity discount**

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We found your online shop while searching the internet and are very interested in your products. We are thinking about ordering a larger quantity of your products if the prices are reasonable. So could you please inform us about possible quantity discounts as well as introductory and cash discounts?

Sincerely

#### **Asking for delivery of ordered goods**

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We found your online shop while searching the internet and were very interested in your products. Unfortunately we have to inform you that the goods we ordered exactly 3 weeks ago haven’t been delivered yet. So we tried to find an order confirmation which we couldn’t find. Something must have gone wrong. Could you please have a look into this matter.

We look forward to an early reply.

Sincerely

John Metzler
