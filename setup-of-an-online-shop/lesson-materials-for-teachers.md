### Sample Email Requests

Send the following sample emails to the online shops and wait for an appropriate answer:

#### **Asking for quantity discount**

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We found your online shop while searching the internet and are very interested in your products. We are thinking about ordering a larger quantity of your products if the prices are reasonable. So could you please inform us about possible quantity discounts as well as introductory and cash discounts?

Sincerely

John Metzler

#### **Asking for delivery of ordered goods**

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We found your online shop while searching the internet and were very interested in your products. Unfortunately we have to inform you that the goods we ordered exactly 3 weeks ago havenâ€™t been delivered yet. So we tried to find an order confirmation which we could not find. Something must have gone wrong. Could you please have a look into this matter.

We look forward to an early reply.

Sincerely

John Metzler

#### Asking for help with cancelling an order

Dear Sir or Madam

Yesterday, I ordered 91 items of your product. Unfortunately, I made a typing mistake and instead of 91 items I initially wanted to purchase 19 items. Would it be possible to cancel the order for 72 items?

I apologise for any inconvenience.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards

#### Asking for help with a return delivery

Dear Sir or Madam

Thank you very much for your delivery which arrived promptly. However, after inspecting the goods I found that two of the items no. ... are damaged. Could you take them back and send a replacement at your expense?

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your trouble.

Kind regards

Jenny Smith
